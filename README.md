Ascenta – Guiding Your Vision
A smart vision-guided system built with the Nicla Vision board

Ascenta is a Diplomarbeit project focused on developing an intelligent guidance system using the Arduino Nicla Vision board. The project explores the potential of compact embedded systems to process visual input and assist with navigation and object recognition in real time.

Designed especially with accessibility in mind, Ascenta aims to support blind and visually impaired individuals by providing environmental feedback and direction through advanced computer vision and edge AI.

Key Features:
Onboard vision processing using Nicla Vision (STM32H747 + Himax HM01B0)

Real-time object detection and scene interpretation

Integration with haptic or auditory feedback systems

Low-power, compact, and responsive design

Modular structure adaptable to various assistive technologies

Applications:
Assistive navigation for blind and visually impaired people

Smart guidance in unfamiliar or complex environments

Wearable or handheld systems for obstacle detection and orientation

Edge AI demonstrations in accessible technology development

Ascenta – See the world through intelligent guidance.
Enhancing independence and awareness with embedded vision.
